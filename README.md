# outdoor_terrain_classification_database
A database of accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer measurements for outdoor terrain classification. The database contains measurements for six outdoor terrain types in .csv format. The .zip file also contains a guide for both filenames and data structure. The detalis of the measurement setup can be found in the following open acces article:
